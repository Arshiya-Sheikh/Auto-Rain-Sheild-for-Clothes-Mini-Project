# ☔ Automatic Rain Shield for Clothes

A smart system that automatically slides clothes under a protective shield when it starts raining — protecting them from getting wet. Ideal for smart homes and rainy regions.

## 🌟 Inspiration

During monsoon season, drying clothes outside becomes a challenge. We designed this project to help protect clothes from unexpected rain without human intervention. The clothesline slides under a protective cover automatically when it starts to rain.

## 🛠️ Features

- Automatically detects rain using sensors
- Uses motor mechanism to slide the clothesline under the shield
- Battery-powered, energy-efficient design
- Simple, practical hardware-based solution for households

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The **rain sensor** detects water droplets when it starts to rain.
2. The sensor sends a signal to the **motor controller** or microcontroller.
3. The **100 RPM motor** activates and pulls the clothesline under a **fixed protective shield**.
4. Once the rain stops, the system can be programmed to return the line to its original position (optional).
